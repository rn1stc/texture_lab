# Texture Lab
This repository for scripts and config files used in NRNU MEPHI Texture Laboratory.
At this moment there are 5 folders:
- damask_proc - for damask pre- and post- processing scripts
- mtex - MATLAB scripts for MTEX
- data_processing - scripts for processing (mostly) experimental data
- PyTritex - script for plotting of crystallographic triangle for cubic and hex lattices
- damask_texture_pp - post processes damask txt output to ebsd data in euler angles and quaternion form for plotting in MTEX. Also, generates mat conf and geom files for damask simulation restart
